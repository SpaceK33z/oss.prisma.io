# API

All examples on this page are based on a GraphQL binding instance for a GraphQL API with the following schema:

```graphql
type Query {
  user(id: ID!): User
  users: [User!]!
}

type Mutation {
  createUser(name: String!): User!
  updateUser(id: ID!, name: String!): User
  deleteUser(id: ID!): User
}

type Subscription {
  userCreated: User!
}

type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
}
```

The GraphQL API above is deployed to this URL: `https://graphql-binding-example-service-kcbreqbsbh.now.sh`

## The `Delegate` class

The `Delegate` class is a binding instance that gives you a lower level API to make GraphQL requests to a GraphQL server.

### Constructor

```ts
constructor({ schema, fragmentReplacements, before }: BindingOptions)
```

Creates a new instance of `Delegate`.

- `schema` (required): An executable instance of a [`GraphQLSchema`](http://graphql.org/graphql-js/type/#graphqlschema) which represents the API that should be abstracted. You can create such an instance by using the `makeExecutableSchema` or `makeRemoteExecutableSchema` functions from the [`graphql-tools`](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphql-tools/) library. Learn more [here](https://blog.graph.cool/graphql-server-basics-the-schema-ac5e2950214e).
- `fragmentReplacements`: A GraphQL fragment that's applied to each query, subscription or mutation sent to the abstracted API.
- `before`: A function that's executed _before_ a query, mutation or subscription request is sent to the abstracted API.

**Example**

```js
const fetch = require('node-fetch')
const { Delegate } = require('graphql-binding/dist/Delegate')
const { HttpLink } = require('apollo-link-http')
const { makeRemoteExecutableSchema } = require('graphql-tools')

const typeDefs = `
  type Query {
    user(id: ID!): User
    users: [User!]!
  }

  type Mutation {
    createUser(name: String!): User!
    updateUser(id: ID!, name: String!): User
    deleteUser(id: ID!): User
  }

  type Subscription {
    userCreated: User!
  }

  type User {
    id: ID!
    name: String!
  }
`

// Create the remote schema
const endpoint = `https://graphql-binding-example-service-kcbreqbsbh.now.sh`
const link = new HttpLink({ uri: endpoint, fetch })
const schema = makeRemoteExecutableSchema({ link, schema: typeDefs })

// Create the `before` function
const before = () => console.log(`Sending a request to the GraphQL API ...`)

const delegate = new Delegate({ schema, before })
```

In this example, we create a new instance of the `Delegate` class. First we take our remote endpoint and make an `HttpLink` which creates an `HTTP` transport for this binding. This means all requests to our GraphQL API are transported via `HTTP`. Next we make a `remote` schema, meaning the schema and it's API's exist on a remote server. The `before` function is unique to the `Delegate` class. Use this to execute code _prior_ to a GraphQL request.

### Methods

#### `before`

```ts
before: () => void
```

A function that's executed _before_ a query, mutation or subscription request is sent to the API. This applies to [`request`](#request), [`delegate`](delegate) and [`delegateSubscription`](#delegateSubscription). This lets you for example modify the `link` that's used to reach the API, implement analytics features or add a logging statement before each API request.

#### `request`

```ts
request<T = any>(query: string, variables?: {
    [key: string]: any;
}): Promise<T>;
```

`request` allows you to send a GraphQL query / mutation to the GraphQL API abstracted by this binding. It is a direct proxy for `request` from `graphql-request`, a library that enables a low level request pattern for GraphQL servers using `fetch`.

- `query` (required): A string that contains the query or mutation
- `variables` (optional): All variables that are defined in the `query` string

**Example: Sending a `createUser` mutation to the API**

```js
const mutation = `
  mutation CreateUserMutation($name: String!) {
    createUser(name: $name) {
      id
      name
    }
  }
`
const variables = { name: `Andy` }

delegate.request(mutation, variables)
  .then(createUserResult => console.log(JSON.stringify(createUserResult)))
  .catch((e) => { console.error(e) })
```

#### `delegate`

```ts
delegate(operation: QueryOrMutation, fieldName: string, args: {
    [key: string]: any;
}, infoOrQuery?: GraphQLResolveInfo | string, options?: Options): Promise<any>;
```

`delegate` allows you to [delegate](https://blog.graph.cool/graphql-schema-stitching-explained-schema-delegation-4c6caf468405) the execution of a query or mutation to the GraphQL API that's abstracted by this binding. This function is often used when building a GraphQL gateway layer.

##### Properties

- `operation` (required): Specifies whether the root field that's targeted by the delegation is query or mutation.
  - Possible values: `query`, `mutation`
- `fieldName` (required): The name of the root field that's targeted by the delegation.
- `args` (required): Any arguments to be passed to the root field that's targeted by the delegation.
- `infoOrQuery` (optional): Either a string or the `info` object - in any case this specifies the selection set for the operation which is send to the GraphQL API that's abstract by this binding.
  - If not provided, the selection set will contain all scalar fields of the requested type except for those with required arguments.
- `options` (optional): The `options` object can have two fields:
  - `transforms` (optional): Allows to perform transformations on the `info` object or the `schema`.
  - `context` (optional): Allows to pass additional information to the GraphQL API that's abstracted.

**Example: Hardcode the selection set as a string:**

```js
const args = { name: `Rowan` }
const selectionSet = `{ id, name }`

delegate.delegate(
  `mutation`,
  `createUser`,
  args,
  selectionSet
)
  .then(createUserResult => console.log(JSON.stringify(createUserResult)))
  .catch((e) => { console.error(e) })
```

</div>


#### `delegateSubscription`

```ts
delegateSubscription(fieldName: string, args?: {
    [key: string]: any;
}, infoOrQuery?: GraphQLResolveInfo | string, options?: Options): Promise<AsyncIterator<any>>;
```

`delegateSubscription` allows you to [delegate](https://blog.graph.cool/graphql-schema-stitching-explained-schema-delegation-4c6caf468405) the execution of a subscription to the GraphQL API that's abstracted by this binding. This function is often used when building a GraphQL gateway layer.

##### Properties

- `fieldName` (required): The name of the root field that's targeted by the delegation.
- `args` (required): Any arguments to be passed to the root field that's targeted by the delegation.
- `infoOrQuery`: Either a string or the `info` object - in any case this specifies the selection set for the operation which is send to the GraphQL API that's abstract by this binding.
- `options` (optional): The `options` object can have two fields:
  - `transforms` (optional): Allows to perform transformations on the `info` object or the `schema`.
  - `context` (optional): Allows to pass additional information to the GraphQL API that's abstracted.

**Example: Selection set based on the `info` object inside a GraphQL resolver**:

```js
const Subscription = {
  userCreatedSub: (parent, args, context, info) => {
    return delegate.delegateSubscription(
      `userCreated`,
      args,
      // passing the info AST from the parent resolver
      info,
      {
        context
      }
    )
  }
}
```

#### `getAbstractResolvers`

```ts
getAbstractResolvers(filterSchema?: GraphQLSchema | string): IResolvers;
```

For _abstract_ GraphQL Types (`Union`, `Interface`), you need to add concrete resolvers to the graphql-js server in order to know which concrete type to return.

## The `Binding` class

Note that in addition to the properties and methods in this section, `Binding` inherits all properties and methods from the `Delegate` class documented above.

### Properties

#### `query`

Exposes all the queries of the GraphQL API that is abstracted by this binding.

#### `mutation`

Exposes all the mutations of the GraphQL API that is abstracted by this binding.

#### `subscriptions`

Exposes all the subscriptions of the GraphQL API that is abstracted by this binding.

#### `addFragmentToInfo`

```ts
addFragmentToInfo(info: GraphQLResolverInfo, fragment: string): GraphQLResolverInfo
```

Can be used to ensure that specific fields are included in the `info` object passed into the bindings.

**Example: Ensure the binding fetches the `email` field from the `User`**.

```js
import ExampleBinding from 'graphql-binding-example'
import { addFragmentToInfo } from 'graphql-binding'

const exampleBinding = new ExampleBinding()

async findUser(parent, args, context, info) {
  const user = await exampleBinding.query.user({ id: args.id }, addFragmentToInfo(info, 'fragment EnsureEmail on User { email }'), { context })

  return user
}
```

## Understanding `Options`

The `Options` type has two fields:

- `transforms` (optional): Allows to perform transformations on the `info` object or the `schema`.
- `context` (optional): Allows to pass additional information to the GraphQL API that's abstracted.

### Transforms

Schema transforms are a tool for making modified copies of GraphQLSchema objects, while preserving the possibility of delegating back to original schema.

Transforms are useful when working with remote schemas, building GraphQL gateways, and working with GraphQL microservices.

More information on `transforms` can be found [here](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/graphql-tools/schema-transforms.html)


### Context

In GraphQL APIs, context can be provided to every resolver that holds important contextual information like the currently logged in user, or access to a database. Utilizing context is extremely crucial for bindings to GraphQL servers that may inherit context from a HTTP request or encode user-specific information to the request.

In the example below we pass through context from the incoming GraphQL resolver to the underlying binding.

```js
import ExampleBinding from 'graphql-binding-example'
import { addFragmentToInfo } from 'graphql-binding'

const exampleBinding = new ExampleBinding()

async findUser(parent, args, context, info) {
  const user = await exampleBinding.query.user({ id: args.id }, info, { context })
  return user
}
```

You could also stamp these values directly:

```js
import ExampleBinding from 'graphql-binding-example'
import { addFragmentToInfo } from 'graphql-binding'

const exampleBinding = new ExampleBinding()

async findUser(parent, args, context, info) {
  // For this request hardcode the user you want to call this api on behalf of.
  const user = await exampleBinding.query.user({ id: args.id }, info, { context: {
    ...context,
    'userid': '4792742323',
  }})
  return user
}
```
